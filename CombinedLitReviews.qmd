This literature review examines Bayesian linear regression (BLR), a
statistical method that uses Bayesian principles to model relationships
between variables. BLR combines prior knowledge with data to make
predictions and manage uncertainty, offering a different approach
compared to traditional Frequentist methods.\
\
Linear regression is a key technique used to predict one variable based
on another by finding the best-fitting line to minimize prediction
errors (“What Is Linear Regression?” 2021). This method is essential in
both Frequentist and Bayesian analyses.\
\
In Bayesian linear regression, Bayes’ theorem updates our beliefs about
model parameters as new data becomes available, leading to a posterior
distribution that reflects a range of possible values instead of just a
single estimate (Bayes 1991). This approach incorporates prior knowledge
and quantifies uncertainty, providing a richer picture than the point
estimates typical in Frequentist statistics (Koehrsen 2018).\
\
The Bayesian Analysis Toolkit (BAT) exemplifies practical applications
of Bayesian methods, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques
for sampling and model comparison. BAT allows for flexible modeling and
efficient numerical integration (Caldwell, Kollár, and Kröninger 2009).
Visualization tools, such as trace plots and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
(HMC) diagnostics, are crucial for assessing model performance and
identifying issues (Gabry et al. 2019). Additional techniques like
posterior predictive checks and leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation
help improve model accuracy.\
\
Research by Zyphur and Oswald (2015) shows that Bayesian methods often
yield more reliable results, especially with small sample sizes, by
incorporating prior knowledge. Van de Schoot et al. (2021) note that
advancements in computing and deep learning have made Bayesian
statistics more relevant, with methods like variational autoencoders
effectively handling complex data.\
\
Gelman et al. (2013) discuss the advantages of Bayesian approaches in
linear regression, emphasizing how they manage uncertainty and enhance
predictive accuracy through prior information. Recent developments in
variational inference, as noted by Blei, Kucukelbir, and McAuliffe
(2017), provide efficient alternatives to traditional MCMC methods by
optimizing posterior approximations.\
\
Carpenter et al. (2017) highlight the usefulness of Bayesian
hierarchical models, which effectively manage data with multiple levels
and capture complex relationships between variables.\
\
In conclusion, this review underscores the strengths of Bayesian linear
regression. By blending prior knowledge with uncertainty management, BLR
provides a flexible and effective framework for analyzing complex data.
With tools like BAT and recent advancements in technology, Bayesian
methods are well-suited for a variety of applications. Future research
should further explore MCMC methods and the foundational principles of
Bayesian linear regression.
