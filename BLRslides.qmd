# **Introduction**

## Objectives

-   **Introduce Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR)**: Understand its
    principles and how it differs from traditional methods.

-   **Explain Bayesian Concepts**: Highlight Bayesâ€™ Theorem, prior
    knowledge, and posterior distributions.

-   **Discuss Practical Applications**: Show how BLR is applied in
    analyzing real-world data, like airline delays.

-   **Explore Advantages of Bayesian Methods**: Quantifying uncertainty,
    improving predictions, and handling complex data.

-   **Present Analysis Findings**: Summarize key insights from our BLR
    model on weather-related airline delays.

## What is Bayesian Linear Regression?

-   **BLR**: A statistical approach combining **prior knowledge** and
    **new data**.

-   **Goal**: Model relationships, make predictions, and handle
    **uncertainty** in estimates.

-   **Difference from Traditional Methods**: Probability-based estimates
    instead of fixed values.

## Introduction to Bayesian Linear Regression

-   Regression under the *frequentist* framework
    -   Independent variables are used to predict dependent variables
    -   Linear regression finds best-fitting line to observed data to
        make further predictions
        -   Regression parameters ($\beta$) are assumed to be fixed
    -   Only collected data is used for approximation
-   Regression under the *Bayesian* framework
    -   Independent variables are used to predict dependent variables
    -   Regression parameters ($\beta$) *are not* assumed to be fixed
    -   Collected data is used alongside prior knowledge for
        approximation

## Why Bayesian?

**Advantages of Bayesian Linear Regression[@Zyphur2015]**

-   **Incorporation of Prior Knowledge**

-   **Uncertainty Quantification**

-   **Expanded Hypotheses**

-   **Automatic Meta-Analyses**

-   **Improved Handling of Small Samples**

-   **Complex Model Estimation**

## Steps in Bayesian Linear Regression

1.  Model Specification: Define the linear relationship between the
    dependent and independent variables.

2.  Choose Priors: Select prior distributions for the model parameters,
    reflecting any existing knowledge about their values.

3.  Data Collection: Gather relevant data for the variables in the
    model.

4.  Model Fitting: Use computational methods, such as Markov Chain Monte
    Carlo (MCMC), to estimate the posterior distributions of the
    parameters based on the observed data.

5.  Result Interpretation: Analyze the posterior distributions to
    understand the relationships between variables, including estimating
    means and credible intervals.

# **Methods**

## Heather's Prior Selection & Model Specification

**Prior Selection**

-   Intercept $(\beta_0)$: $\beta_0 \sim N(0, 5^2)$ Assumes no strong
    baseline effect.

-   Slope $(\beta_1)$: $\beta_1 \sim N(0, 5^2)$ Reflects no strong prior
    belief about the relationship between weather incidents and delays.

-   Error Term $(\sigma)$: $\sigma \sim \text{Exp}(1)$ Accounts for
    variability in delays; allows flexibility.

**Model Specification**

$Y_i \mid \beta_0, \beta_1, \sigma \sim N(\mu_i, \sigma^2)$
$\mu_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i$

-   $Y_i$: Arrival delay (minutes)\
-   $X_i$: Weather-related incidents

# **Conclusion**

## Key Findings

-   **Intercept**: -2116.53 (95% CI: \[-2131.41, -2100.91\])

    -   Indicates significantly shorter delays without weather
        incidents.

-   **Weather Count Coefficient**: 1041.97 (95% CI: \[1036.73,
    1047.15\])

    -   A **1-unit increase in weather incidents** leads to an average
        **1042-minute delay**.

    -   Weather incidents are **infrequent but highly disruptive**.

-   **Uncertainty Measures**:

    -   Residual variability: **Standard deviation = 8676.19**.

    -   Suggests other unmeasured factors affecting delays.

-   **Model Diagnostics**:

    -   **Rhat = 1.00** for all parameters, indicating convergence.

    -   Large **effective sample sizes** ensure reliable posterior
        estimates.

## Conclusion

-   **Key Insight**:

    -   Weather-related incidents, though infrequent, have a
        **disproportionately large impact** on delay times.

    -   Highlights the need for better **weather management and
        forecasting**.

-   **Bayesian Approach**:

    -   Accounts for **uncertainty**, providing credible intervals for
        estimates.

    -   Supports **informed decision-making** in airline operations and
        policy-making.

## Discussion and Future Research

-   What other factors could be included in the model?

-   How could expanding the dataset improve insights?

-   What advanced Bayesian methods could be explored?

-   How should outliers be addressed?

-   What assumptions should be revisited?
