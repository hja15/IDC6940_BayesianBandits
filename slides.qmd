## Data Exploration and Visualization {.smaller}

A study was conducted to determine how...

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=F, message=FALSE}
# loading packages 
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(ggrepel)
library(dslabs)
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=F}
# Load Data
#kable(head(murders))

ggplot1 = murders %>% ggplot(mapping = aes(x=population/10^6, y=total)) 

  ggplot1 + geom_point(aes(col=region), size = 4) +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label=abb)) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  geom_smooth(formula = "y~x", method=lm,se = F)+
  xlab("Populations in millions (log10 scale)") + 
  ylab("Total number of murders (log10 scale)") +
  ggtitle("US Gun Murders in 2010") +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Region")+
      theme_bw()
  

```

## Modeling and Results

-   Explain your data preprocessing and cleaning steps.
