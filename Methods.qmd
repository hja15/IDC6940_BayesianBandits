## **Data Source**

The dataset utilized in this analysis is derived from the "Airline Delay
Cause" dataset, which encompasses flight arrival and delay information
for U.S. airports. The dataset includes various attributes such as the
number of arriving flights, delay reasons, cancellations, and
diversions, spanning multiple years and airlines. For this study, the
focus was specifically on data from August 2023, which consists of
171,666 observations.

## **Data Preparation**

Prior to analysis, the dataset was cleaned and preprocessed. Missing
values were identified and handled appropriately to ensure the
robustness of the model. Specifically, we filtered out any observations
where the dependent variable (arrival delay) or independent variables
(carrier delays, weather delays, and NAS delays) were missing. The
cleaning process ensured that our dataset only included relevant entries
for the analysis.

## **Variables**

The dependent variable in this analysis was the total arrival delay
(arr_delay), measured in minutes. The independent variables included:

-   **Weather Count (weather_ct)**: The number of delays attributed to
    weather-related issues.

-   **Carrier Count (carrier_ct)**: The number of delays attributed to
    airline-related issues.

-   **NAS Count (nas_ct)**: The number of delays attributed to the
    National Airspace System.

## **Bayesian Linear Regression Model**

Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR) is a powerful statistical method that
combines the principles of linear regression with Bayesian inference.
This approach allows us to model the relationship between a dependent
variable (e.g., flight arrival delays) and one or more independent
variables (e.g., weather-related delays, carrier-related delays, and NAS
delays) while incorporating uncertainty and prior beliefs about these
relationships. To analyze the impact of the independent variables on
arrival delays, a Bayesian linear regression model was implemented using
the brms package in R [@R]. The model was formulated as follows:

$$
\text{arr\_delay} \sim \text{weather\_ct} + \text{carrier\_ct} + \text{nas\_ct}
$$

This model specification allows us to assess the relationship between
arrival delays and the specified delay reasons while accounting for the
uncertainty inherent in the data.

### Key Concepts

1.  Linear Regression: The basic form of linear regression models the
    relationship between the dependent variable \\( y \\) and
    independent variables \\( x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n \\) using a linear
    equation: \$\$ y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 +
    \\ldots + \\beta_n x_n + \\epsilon \$\$ Here, \\( \\beta_i \\)
    represents the coefficients that indicate the strength and direction
    of the relationships, and \\( \\epsilon \\) is the error term.
2.  Bayesian Inference: In Bayesian statistics, we update our beliefs
    about parameters using Bayes’ theorem: \$\$ P(\\beta \|
    \\text{data}) = \\frac{P(\\text{data} \| \\beta) \\cdot
    P(\\beta)}{P(\\text{data})} \$\$ This formula allows us to derive
    the posterior distribution of the parameters after observing the
    data, taking into account our prior beliefs \\( P(\\beta) \\) and
    the likelihood of the data given those parameters \\( P(\\text{data}
    \| \\beta) \\).

### Steps in Bayesian Linear Regression

1.  **Model Specification**: Define the linear relationship between the
    dependent and independent variables.

2.  **Choose Priors**: Select prior distributions for the model
    parameters, reflecting any existing knowledge about their values.

3.  **Data Collection**: Gather relevant data for the variables in the
    model.

4.  **Model Fitting**: Use computational methods, such as Markov Chain
    Monte Carlo (MCMC), to estimate the posterior distributions of the
    parameters based on the observed data.

5.  **Result Interpretation**: Analyze the posterior distributions to
    understand the relationships between variables, including estimating
    means and credible intervals.

### Conclusion

Bayesian Linear Regression offers a comprehensive framework for
analyzing the factors influencing flight delays, making it an invaluable
tool for understanding complex interactions in the aviation industry.

## **Model Fitting**

The Bayesian model was fitted using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
methods, with the following parameters:

-   **Chains**: 4

-   **Iterations**: 2000

-   **Warmup**: 1000

These settings were chosen to ensure adequate convergence and to provide
a stable estimate of the posterior distribution.

## **Prior Distributions**

Prior distributions for the model coefficients were specified as normal
distributions with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 5, reflecting
a relatively uninformative prior that allows the data to inform the
posterior distributions.

## **Model Assessment**

Model diagnostics were conducted to evaluate convergence and the quality
of the fitted model. The summary of the model output, along with trace
plots, was examined to ensure that the MCMC chains had stabilized and
adequately explored the parameter space.

## **Why Bayesian?**

Bayesian methods have some great advantages that make them a good fit
for this analysis. They allow us to bring in prior knowledge, making the
results more informed. Plus, they make it easier to understand what the
findings mean, especially when we’re working with smaller datasets.
Bayesian approaches also do a fantastic job of capturing uncertainty,
which is really important when we’re dealing with something as complex
as airline delays, where a lot of different factors are at play.
Overall, these features help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on
in the data.
